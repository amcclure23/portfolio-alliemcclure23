I decided to make one big project for the last 4 demonstrations to make it easier for gading and so I did not have to copy the project 4 times.

I named it the sisyphus project because I was inspired by his story of his never ending task.
website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus
here is a link if you want to read more about him.

I demonstrat 4 concepts in this video.
Using oculus interaction sdk and handtracking I created a rig that can:
1. grab and throw things
2. raycast point select
3. poke interact with a gui

the fourth thing I demonstrate is 3d audio on the annoying cube.

While it looks really simple, learning the interaction sdk was really hard and the making the rig from scratch had a lot of trial and error cause there isnt a ton of info on the sdk. a good bit of info was out of date.
